# The ODI Global Node Network

This is an open dataset of [Open Data Institute Nodes](https://theodi.org/nodes/).

## What are ODI Nodes?

ODI Nodes connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data, led by local experts.

Operating at city or regional levels, ODI Nodes:
  * Develop and deliver training to equip people with new skills
  * Connect people and businesses through membership and events
  * Communicate stories that inspire people around the world

Through peer-learning and collaboration, the network highlights the case for open innovation, and brings people together around our collective vision: knowledge for everyone. The network spans over 20 countries.
